Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity among women globally. However, BI-RADS Category 4 includes a wide range of malignancy probabilities (over 2% to 95%), leading to potential overdiagnosis and unnecessary procedures like biopsies, which can cause physical trauma and financial strain.
To address these issues, we have developed a ** MobileNet-CBAM model**, which integrates MobileNet with the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance the prediction of malignancy in BI-RADS Category 4 cases.
Model explanations are provided using SHAP for better clinical understanding and trust.
